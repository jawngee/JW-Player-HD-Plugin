		This plugin implements an HD quality toggle in the controlbar. 
		An icon is shown to do the toggle, and the value is saved as a cookie. 
		This plugin works for single files and playlists (in the latter case, a new playlist is loaded).
		For the 4.5 button or higher, the plugin can also place a button in the dock.
		As of version 1.3, the plugin will not restart the video after a switch when using streaming servers.
